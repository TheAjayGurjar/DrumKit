# DrumKit
A simple web page which detects key presses and clicks which play sound according to it. It works like a drum kit. This project is the implementation of what I learned in my web developer journey. It implements query selector, DOM, DOM manipulation, EventListener, time out function and other advance Javascript concepts.
